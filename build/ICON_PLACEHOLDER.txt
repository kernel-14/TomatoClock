PLACEHOLDER ICON FILE

This is a placeholder for the application icon (icon.ico).

To complete the build configuration, you need to:

1. Create or obtain a proper application icon in ICO format
2. Name it "icon.ico"
3. Place it in this directory (build/)
4. The icon should contain multiple resolutions: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256

Recommended icon design:
- Theme: Pomodoro timer (tomato + clock elements)
- Style: Modern, minimalist
- Colors: Red/orange for tomato, with clean lines
- Ensure it's recognizable at small sizes

You can use online tools or design software to create the icon:
- Online: https://www.icoconverter.com/
- Software: Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, Inkscape

Until a proper icon is provided, electron-builder will use a default icon,
but this may trigger warnings during the build process.
